Before looking at any of these solutions, you should try to solve the problem on your own.

DISCLAIMER:

Some of these solutions might not actually work by just running them. Some are quite hacked together so the
solution may not be marked by the end of the program's execution.

They also might not all run in under 1 minute, but none should ever be over ten, I don't ever think I was that
patient of a person.
